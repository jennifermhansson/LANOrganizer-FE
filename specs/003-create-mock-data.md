Building a hackathon project calld lan hub

the idea is that players at the lan enter their steamId into their ui that get send to backend which holds all of the users games. Then the idea is to finde the games that everyone can play. 

Few questions what should the shape of the return array etc be. 

ie just an array of the games that they dan play

or basically each of the users that c  const setView = useStore((state) => state.setView);urrently is in the room and their games so that we can find the games that they can play in the frontend
